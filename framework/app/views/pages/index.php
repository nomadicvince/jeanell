  <p>The Jeanell PHP Framework uses OOP in an MVC pattern. I use this framework for my personal PHP projects. This framework is open source and can be used by anyone for any reason.</p>
  <p>Note: This framework is in Alpha and has limited functionality. I will add more functionality as I get the time to do so.</p>
